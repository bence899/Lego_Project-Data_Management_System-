Categorising Lego Pieces into groups (Integrating an Inventory control System)
We had a client that provided young students with the opportunity to study computer science, through a more creative way where they used Lego pieces to make robots and using python to program these robots. Our client had a problem in the maintenance of the Lego pieces, as it was hard to keep track of it all and provide the correct pieces for the correct model, and therefore we have been asked by our client to develop such a database which helps to solve this issue.
